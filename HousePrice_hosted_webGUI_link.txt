- RMSE: ~$25,000-$35,000 (average prediction error)
- MAE: ~$18,000-$25,000 (median prediction error)
- Cross-Validation R²: ~0.84-0.88 (consistent performance)

# ===========================================
# FEATURES USED
# ===========================================

Selected 6 features from the recommended 9:
1. OverallQual - Overall material and finish quality (1-10)

# ===========================================
# API ENDPOINTS
# ===========================================

The application provides the following API endpoints:

1. POST /api/predict
   - JSON prediction endpoint
   - Returns price prediction with confidence intervals

2. GET /api/neighborhoods
   - List of valid neighborhoods

3. GET /api/model-info
   - Model metadata and performance metrics

4. GET /health
   - Health check endpoint for monitoring

# ===========================================
# NOTES
# ===========================================

- Model file (house_price_model.pkl) must be in the model/ directory
- Training data (train.csv) is required only for model development
- Web application loads model at startup for fast predictions
- All input validation is handled server-side
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
